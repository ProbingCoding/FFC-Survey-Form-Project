# FFC-Survey-Form-Project
My personal freeCodeCamp survey form project. Put some real effort into this as a brand new coder. It's imperfect but I'm reasonably satisfied with my output, for a first attempt. Any feedback is encouraged. Would LOVE to put radio and checkboc inputs on the same line as their label text!!!!! Couldn't get it done.
